I’m sharing the Ttrend application with all of you! I’d like to thank the folks who helped me design and build this app. It has many features and I’d like to point out these key features:

1. Main and Test Folders. These folders are intended to be used by anyone who has downloaded the application. Main contains all application code. Test contains test cases.

2. Pom.xml. This file is also included in the main folder, and it contains all of the dependencies, artifact names, and versions.
